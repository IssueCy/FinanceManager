        <h4>Last Updated: 27/08/2024</h4>
        <p>
          Thank you for using Finance Manager. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data, ensuring transparency in our practices.
          <br>
          <br>
          1. No Cookies
          <br>
          Our app does not use cookies. We do not track your online behavior, nor do we place any cookies on your device to gather information. Your data remains on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties.
          <br>
          <br>
          2. Data Storage
          <br>
          All data generated within the app is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or process any personal data on external servers. This ensures that your information is kept secure and under your control.
          <br>
          <br>
          3. No Data Collection
          <br>
          We do not collect any data from you or your device. This includes but is not limited to:
          <br>
          Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, or phone number.
          Behavioral data such as usage patterns, preferences, or activities within the app.
          <br>
          <br>
          4. User Control Over Data
          <br>
          You have full control over your data. Our app provides features that allow you to:
          <br>
          Export Data: You can export your data at any time to have a backup or for use on other devices.
          Delete Data: You can delete your data at any time. Once deleted, it is permanently erased from your device and cannot be recovered.
          <br>
          <br>
          5. Security
          <br>
          We prioritize the security of your data. Although we do not transmit data over the internet, we recommend using security measures such as device encryption and strong passwords to protect your device from unauthorized access.

          <br>
          6. Data Sharing

          <br>
          7. Third-Party Services
          <br>
          This app does not integrate with any third-party services or tools that collect or process your data. We maintain a standalone environment to ensure the highest level of privacy.
          <br>
          <br>
          8. Offline Functionality
          <br>
          Our app is designed to work offline. There is no need for an internet connection, and your data will never be transmitted online. This enhances your privacy by keeping all information localized on your device.
          <br>
          <br>
          9. Children's Privacy
          <br>
          We do not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since no data collection occurs, there is no risk of children's data being stored or processed. If you believe that your child has used the app and inadvertently entered personal information, please ensure their data is deleted through the app's functionality.
          <br>
          <br>
